Scripts and Results of Using VGG16

The code has been adopted from : https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html .

Most specifically, it is from the script "bottlenect_pretrained_script_02.py"

There are five data folders: data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, and data_04. "YAL" stands for Yes-Alzheimers" and "NAL" stands for "No-Alzheimers". The number of files in "alzheimers" and "nonalzheimers" must match. To get download the data, please go to. The number of images must match between alzheimers and nonalzheimers.
The following structure is necessary:
    data_##:
         train
            alzheimers
               YAL0001.jpg
               YAL0002.jpg
               etc...
            nonalzheimers
               NAL0001.jpg
               NAL0002.jpg
               etc...
         validation
            alzheimers
               YAL0001.jpg
               YAL0002.jpg
               etc...
            nonalzheimers
               NAL0001.jpg
               NAL0002.jpg
               etc...

I am using 5-fold with a total of 6400 images. 2560 training for each and 640 validation for each.
To obtain this data, please go to Ryerson_MRP/MRI_32_Images, folders data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, and data_04.

The number of epochs used are : 100 and 150 .
With 100 epochs my accuracy is : 0.9445
With 140 epochs my accuracy is : 0.9484
With 150 epochs my accuracy is : 0.9355
The batch size is 40.

Since 140 epochs worked the best, however, it is comparable to the accuracy of 100 epochs.

Therefore, 100 epochs is used.

All "VGG16_bottleneck_data_0#.py" scripts are very similar except:

Rename "00" to the appropriate data batch number.

top_model_weights_path = 'bottleneck_00.h5'
train_data_dir = 'data_00/train'
validation_data_dir = 'data_00/validation'
nb_train_samples = 5120
nb_validation_samples = 1280
epochs = 150
batch_size = 40
